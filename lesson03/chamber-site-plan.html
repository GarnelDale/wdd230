        <h2>Site Name</h2>
        <p>Ald'ruhn Chamber of Commerce</p>
        <h2>Site Purpose</h2>
        <p>To provide a network of communication for the various merchants of Ald'ruhn and to provide a resource of visitors of the city to find the services they are looking for. To do this a join service will be necessary for merchants of Ald'ruhn and a listing of all registered merchants with locations will be required for visitors to the city.</p>
        <h2>Scenarios</h2>
        <p>
            A long time resident of Ald'ruhn is curious about what is currently available in the city following a slew of recent openings.<br>
            A visitor to the city is looking for what is around to do. <br>
            A new business owner in the city has been informed of the site and its use as a networking tool for the merchants and is looking to join. 
        </p>
        <h2>Color Schema</h2>
        <p>The background color for the header, footer, and major page divisions will be <span id="red">#7b2210</span></p>
        <p>The main background color for the page will be #feeed4. This will also serve as the font color for sections of the page with background of red.</p>
        <h2>Typography</h2>
        <p>The font for the headings will be <span id="magic">Magic Card Normal</span> as that is the primary font of Morrowind, the game where Ald'ruhn is from.</p>
