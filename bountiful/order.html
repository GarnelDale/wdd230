The Order Drink page contains a form that allows the user to order a specialty drink.
The form requires the following items: 
first name, email and phone number
three (3) select inputs that are populated with all the available fruit to put into a drink.
Available fruit options must only come from this web service: https://www.fruityvice.com/Links to an external site. for full credit consideration. 
If desired you can download the JSON file from https://www.fruityvice.com/Links to an external site. and use that locally in your site.
Also, include an area that allows them to add special instructions if needed.
Mention in the form somewhere that payment is received when the drink is picked up.
The form submission takes you to the Order Confirmation page to show you what you ordered.
